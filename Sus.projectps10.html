    <p class="ps5-">In the past three years we have slowly seen what the future is going to look like for the <br>
            foreseeable future. Because of the hardware games have become exclusive only to the PS5, <br>
            games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart and Spider Man 2.  So all games are going to be exclusive to PS5.

<h2 class="ps-">A New Horizon</h2>

    <p class="new-g">With the PS5  games can go in bigger directions like with Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart<br>
        with the new ability in the game where you go through a portal across dimensions. It is only <br>
        possible because of the PS5 ability reminder things so fast that loading is a thing of the past.<br>
    </p> 

    <p class="new-g">Along with the PS5 ability to remind things fast ,it also can go beautifully in the game <br>
        Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart look just like a Pixar Movie. The PS5 easily runs games on a 4K <br>
        Ultra HD which would look gorgeous on a tv.</p>

    <p class="ne-me">This year on October 23rd 2023, I will be turning 14 years old. This going be my last <br>
        year in middle school. Soon I will be going to high school, I’m going to be doing bigger and <br>
        better things. Which means that I will have more responsibilities placed on me, but it also means <br>
        the media I watch and play is going to play. Now I look in my media for things that will have <br>
        more substance than lego games or little kid stuff. And the PS5 has that kind of stuff like Final <br>
        Fantasy, God of War, and Spider Man.</p>

    <p class="ne-me">One thing all these games that are alike is that their stories are deeper than games I was <br>
        playing when I was younger like Lego Marvel.</p>
    
    <h3 class="list-p-ps5">Here is a list of some perks.</h3>


    <ul>
        <li class="Perks-ps5">You can play ps4 games on ps5.</li>

        <li class="Perks-ps5">Can play the ps5 on a phone or a different device.</li>

        <li class="Perks-ps5">It is a new console and it’s lifetime has just started.</li>

        <li class="Perks-ps5">It’s a new console and probably going to last 5 to 6 more years before the next console<br> 
            generation comes out. And then  2 more years till I need to get a new console.</li>
        
        <li class="Perks-ps5">It will probably be the last console you'll buy for me.</li>
    
        </ul>
    
    
    <p class="caution-ps5">Please get the normal version not the digtal version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
